    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has never been easier for people to teach themself programming. Whether you are learning from a popular online tutorial, or the CS textbook of your friend. At some point, learning object-oriented programming will almost be an inevidable part of your journey. It was when you first learned that the three basic fundamentals of OOP: &quot;Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism&quot;. The three great, profound ideas that makes everyone&#39;s code better. But the words themself doesn&#39;t make much sense to you, so you were given an example:</span>

<blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
        <em><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">First let&#39;s us take a look at Inheritance. Use the school as an example, everyone is a person, so they would all inherit from the class Person. Such as student and faculty. Student would have special attributes such as GPA, and faculty will have special attributes such as wages. Professor would also inherit the class faculty with additional attributes such as classesTaught, since professor is-a faculty.</span></em>
    </p>

<p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Such simple concept, yet such clever idea. When writing a program, simply describe the logical relationship between each object and you will increase your productivity, increase code reusability, readability, and write less bug-prone code.</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what about TA?&quot; some might think. Isn&#39;t TA both a faculty and&nbsp;a student? So I would just have the class TA inherit from both Student and Faculty. Right?</span>

<p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunatly you can&#39;t. But don&#39;t worry! As a beginner coder you yet have much to learn. People have invented design patterns that <strong>solves</strong>&nbsp;<strong>many issues</strong> like this. As you learn more about OOP, you will be capable of solving these problems, and grow as a programmer.................. Right?</span>

    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how the world seduce another individual into the pit hole of OOP. When people need to use special design pattern in order to intergrate the idea of TA into the &quot;university system&quot;, how much potential do you still see in such design principle? Indeed, OOP program is &quot;easy to implement&quot; as it transfer our interpertation of relationship between real world objects directly into the design of program structure. This has guarenteed that any individual with any mental capability to be able to write OOP program. With a fake promise that OOP would work automatically.</span>

<p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might start arguing, &quot;as long as you follow strictly to the OOP design patterns, you would be able to write OOP code with intuitive structure and high reusability.&quot; So here is another example where OOP unexpected bug (Effective Java #16):</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
    <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;"></span>
</p>
<pre class="brush:java;toolbar:false">public class MyHashSet&lt;E&gt; extends HashSet&lt;E&gt; {
    private int addCount = 0;
    public int getAddCount() {
        return addCount;
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean add(E e) {
        addCount++;
        return super.add(e);
    }
    
    @Override
    public boolean addAll(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt; c) {
        addCount += c.size();
        return super.addAll(c);
    }
}</pre>
<p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
    <span style="font-family:times new roman">But the code won&#39;t work.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;;">The error occurs because under super.addAll it adds elements through issuing function call towards add. Based on polymorphism function call towards add will then get transfered into the add function under MyHashSet, therefore allAll will add element twice. This error seemed somewhat obvious, but when the project gets large one can never avoid random problem like that unless he knew every single implementation detail of the project. But wait, isn&#39;t one of the clear advantage that OOP ought to bring us is portability. While in reality as the a project gets larger and larger, people will be forbidden from making changes towards parent class since many unexpected error might occur. This type of code base is also known as the &quot;shit mountain&quot; - all those shit will fall on your head when you try to change its center.</span>
